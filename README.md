Trail Making Test App

Overview

This project aims to develop a digital version of the Trail Making Test using Expo and React Native. The Trail Making Test is a neuropsychological test of visual attention and task switching. It consists of two parts: Part A requires the subject to connect a series of 25 encircled numbers distributed on a sheet of paper, while Part B requires connecting encircled numbers and letters in an alternating sequence.

The digital version of this test is intended to be used on an iPad or tablet and will be utilized by a Ph.D. candidate for their thesis defense, provided pro bono by UpperMinds.
